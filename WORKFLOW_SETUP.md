# GitHub Actions Setup Complete

## What Was Created

This implementation provides a complete CI/CD solution for your Flutter app to build Android App Bundles (AAB) and publish them to Google Play Store automatically.

## Files Added

### 1. `.github/workflows/android-release.yml`
**Main production workflow** - Triggers on:
- Push to main/master branches
- Version tags (v*)
- Manual trigger
- Pull requests (build only, no publish)

**What it does:**
- Sets up Flutter 3.24.0 and Java 11
- Runs tests for quality assurance
- Creates Android signing configuration from GitHub secrets
- Builds signed Android App Bundle (AAB)
- Publishes to Google Play Store production track
- Saves AAB as downloadable artifact

### 2. `.github/workflows/build-test.yml`
**Test/validation workflow** - Triggers on:
- Manual trigger
- Weekly scheduled run (Mondays 2 AM UTC)

**What it does:**
- Builds debug and unsigned release APKs
- Runs Flutter analyze and tests
- Provides build validation without publishing

### 3. `.github/workflows/README.md`
**Complete setup guide** with:
- Required GitHub secrets configuration
- Google Play Console setup instructions
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

### 4. Updated Files
- **README.md** - Added workflow documentation
- **.gitignore** - Added keystore file exclusions

## Next Steps to Use

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to your repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, then add:

**Android Signing:**
- `KEYSTORE_BASE64` - Your keystore file as base64
- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` - Keystore password
- `KEY_ALIAS` - Key alias name
- `KEY_PASSWORD` - Key password

**Google Play:**
- `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` - Service account JSON

### 2. Google Play Console Setup
1. Create service account in Google Cloud Console
2. Enable Google Play Android Developer API
3. Link service account in Play Console
4. Grant "Release manager" permissions

### 3. Testing
- Push code to main/master to trigger the workflow
- Or use "Actions" tab → "Build and Publish Android App Bundle" → "Run workflow"

## Workflow Features

✅ **Secure** - No sensitive data in code, all via GitHub secrets
✅ **Automated** - Builds and publishes on every main branch push
✅ **Tested** - Runs Flutter tests before building
✅ **Flexible** - Multiple trigger options including manual
✅ **Artifact Storage** - Saves AAB files for download
✅ **Version Control** - Works with git tags for versioning

## Security Notes

- Keystore files are never committed to repository
- All secrets are handled via GitHub's secure secret system
- Temporary files are created during build and cleaned up
- Service account has minimal required permissions

The implementation follows Google Play Store and Flutter best practices for automated deployment.
